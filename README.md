## What is Beads?

Beads is an AI-native issue tracking system that lives directly in your codebase. Issues are stored in `.beads/*.db` SQLite files and sync with git, making them perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want issues close to code.

## Architecture

The extension uses a clean architecture with three main layers:

- **Extension Host** (`src/extension.ts`): Command registration, webview lifecycle, message routing
- **Data Adapters**:
  - `src/beadsAdapter.ts`: sql.js in-memory adapter
  - `src/daemonBeadsAdapter.ts`: CLI-based daemon adapter
- **Webview UI** (`media/board.js`, `media/styles.css`): Reactive UI with incremental loading

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
